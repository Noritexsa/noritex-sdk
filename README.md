# Getting Started

Noritex Styled Components SDK allows users to style your website using the necesary CSS only withouth having to import a big library.

Regardless of the technologies and tools behind them, a successful design system follows these guiding principles:

-   **It’s consistent**. The way components are built and managed follows a predictable pattern.
-   **It’s self-contained**. Your design system is treated as a standalone dependency.
-   **It’s reusable**. You’ve built components so they can be reused in many contexts.
-   **It’s accessible**. Applications built with your design system are usable by as many people as possible.
-   **It’s robust**. No matter the product or platform to which your design system is applied, it should perform with grace and minimal bugs.
